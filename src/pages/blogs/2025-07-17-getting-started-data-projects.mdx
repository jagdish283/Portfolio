As someone who started with basic knowledge in programming and databases, my journey into real-world data projects has been exciting, challenging, and deeply rewarding.

## 💡 How It All Started

I began with simple Python scripts and SQL queries. Over time, I realized that data isn't just about tables and rows — it's about **insights** that drive decisions.

That’s when I started learning tools like:

- **Snowflake** for cloud-based data warehousing  
- **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards  
- **Python** for data processing and ML  
- **SQL** for querying structured data  
- **Cloud platforms** (like GCP & AWS) for deployment and scalability  

## 🚀 My First Real-World Project

One of my first major projects involved analyzing traffic patterns using a public dataset from Bangalore City.

Here’s what I did:

- Cleaned and transformed the data using Python & Pandas  
- Stored and queried the data using Snowflake  
- Created powerful dashboards in Power BI  
- Shared insights through storytelling and reports  

This project helped me understand how real-time data, automation, and cloud tools can come together to build impactful solutions.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech Stack I Used

- Python (Pandas, Streamlit)  
- SQL  
- Snowflake  
- Power BI  
- GitHub  
- Gradio (for simple AI UI experiments)  

## 💭 Key Learnings

1. **Start small, but think big** – even small datasets can unlock great insights.  
2. **Cloud is not optional anymore** – tools like Snowflake make it easier to scale.  
3. **Visuals matter** – Power BI helped me turn data into decisions.  
4. **Consistency beats complexity** – finish something simple, then improve.  

## 🌱 What’s Next?

I’m now exploring **Generative AI**, **real-time analytics**, and integrating **chatbots with data pipelines**.

I also aim to contribute to open-source and mentor beginners entering this field.
